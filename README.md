# Saathi (CovidHelp-MicrosoftBotChallenge)
A chatbot hackathon for Microsoft Interns in Summer 2020 using Azure technologies.

**Saathi** means friend in Hindi. Saathi is your chatbot friend to help you in these difficult times. It is a platform to connect people who are in need to the people who are willing to help. It basically creates a network of community and volunteers.

Saathi is very simple solution and our small contribution to make this world a better place to live in.


## How does Saathi work?

There are two sides to this project. One side of the platform is focused towards people seeking help. The other side is focused towards people willing to volunteer.
